Whites make up 73% of the total population of the United States and White male and female enrollment in schools makes up approximately half of the total enrollment. While Blacks and Asians make up about 13% and 5% of the total population respectively, they only make up a combined 19% of the total enrollment compared to Hispanic enrollment at about 26% with a total population of approximately 4.8%. There are just as many males than there are females making up the total population which is the case for school enrollment with enrollment of males slightly higher.
